# Work on bash script to automate commands to create video from images in a folder 

# Make a file list: 
#  ls *.jpg | sort -V | xargs -I {} echo "file '{}'" > list.txt

# Make a file list with names for safer addressing: 
# for f in *.jpg; do echo "file '$PWD/$f'" >> filelist.txt; done 

# Use ffmpeg on the file list: 
# ffmpeg -r 1 -f concat -safe 0 -i filelist.txt video.mp4
